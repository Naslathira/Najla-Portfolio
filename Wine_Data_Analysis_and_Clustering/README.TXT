PROJECT TITLE: Wine Data Analysis (School Project)

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This project focuses on analyzing structured data using Python in a Jupyter notebook. The dataset contains chemical analysis results of wines grown by three different cultivators in the same Italian region. The analysis covers 13 chemical components across 178 wine samples.

AUTHORS: Najla Athira Anggoro Putri

Key tasks include:
1.Data Preparation – Identifying and handling missing data, ensuring data quality.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Performing univariate and bivariate analysis with visualizations.
3. Statistical Analysis – Calculating mean and standard deviation for each chemical component by cultivator.
4. Correlation Analysis – Exploring relationships between variables for each cultivator using visualizations.
5. K-Means Clustering – Identifying potential clusters and assessing alignment with EDA findings.
5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Reducing dimensionality, analyzing variance, and visualizing key components.

The goal is to gain practical experience in structured data analysis, ensuring clear documentation and interpretation of results.
